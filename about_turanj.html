  <h1>About Turanj</h1>
  <p><img src="slike/turanj-riva.jpg" align="right" />Turanj is an attractive 
    tourist village, with population of about 1200, placed on a very beautiful spot surrounded 
    by 15 small islands. It spreads over about 3 miles of Pašman canal coast. 
    It is placed between Biograd and Zadar, which makes it a quiet and peaceful 
    Mediterranean village still close to center of region.</p>
  <h2>History of Turanj</h2>
  <p>Turanj area was almost constantly populated since Bronze Age, and the oldest 
    archeological remains are dated in early Stone Age. In Bronze Age there were 
    settlements around Turanj area, mostly placed on nearby hills and the remains 
    of one of them were even found on island Ričul (Zeleni školj - Greeen island). 
    At that time island was really a peninsula connected with shore, so it was 
    perfect for building a little antic port. In the age of Roman empire a great Roman villa was built there, because of its 
    position from which it was possible to control ships passing through Pašman 
    canal. Later on a village called Tukljača was settled there and a church was 
    built on foundations of Roman villa. Church was consecrated to saint Mary 
    (Stella Maris).</p>
  <p>Name of Turanj first appeared in historical documents in the 13th century. In 
    the year of 1444 Croatian aristocratic family Meštrović built a fort two miles 
    to the southeast of Tukljača, and Turanj was named after that fort (from Latin 
    turis, which means fort). Fort was built on the very coast, and walls were 
    supported by three towers. One of these towers still exists along with a few 
    parts of fort walls and the main gate. At the age of wars with Turks Turanj was 
    attacked and burnt down few times, and population was forced to escape on 
    nearby islands to survive. Inside Turanj walls there was a church of Mala 
    Gospa (Ružarica), which was burnt down during the war by Ibrahim pasha, but later a new 
    church was built on that spot and consecrated to Gospa od Karmela (Lady 
    of Carmel).<br />
    One interesting thing is that in the year of 1527 Turanj had population of 
    144, while Biograd had only 70 at that time. </p>
